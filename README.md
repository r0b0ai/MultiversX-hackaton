Web Content Scraper API: This application helps you grab content from your favorite websites and also process some files you upload.

What Can This Do?
Scrape Websites: Give us a website link, and we'll fetch the content for you!
Process Files: Got a file? Upload it, and we'll handle the magic!

Website chatbot API: This application offers users a way to interact with content specific to them, returning relevant responses based on the dialogs they created themselves, or dialogs created with the help of AI. Users have the flexibility to craft their own dialogs throught our dialog creation GUI, or simply upload a file/link, allowing the AI system to handle the intricate process of dialog creation. By providing a query, users can obtain information that is relevant to their context, ensuring a more personalized experience. 

API for handling conversation: Built to engage in dynamic user interactions, this API interprets user queries in context and returns responses based on specific documents, modules, and content tailored for individual users. The API goes beyond keyword matching. It understands user queries in context, ensuring that the responses are more relevant and contextually accurate.

Note: Keeping in line with business confidentiality, because we have business in Slovenia, the full codebase cannot be disclosed. But, to offer a glimpse into our system's operation and design, we've shared image examples.

We understand the importance of convenience and flexibility. That's why we've introduced multiple methods for our users to add dialogs seamlessly.
Users can create dialogs throught our GUI dialog crafter manually, or just upload a file/link to the relevant data, and leverage the power of AI to take the wheel of dialog creation. 
Our system lets you craft dialogs with ease, reminiscent of crafting a Facebook post.
